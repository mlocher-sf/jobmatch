    <h1>Storyboard</h1>

    <blockquote>
      The user interface design can be largely encapsulated by a storyboard. <p>
	A storyboard is a visual way of describing a user's navigation paths through the application. It provides an outline of the application's user interface, and a framework from which the rest of the application design can proceed. A conceptual storyboard that is largely an application flow chart is sometimes referred to as a site map, in contrast to a mocked-up HTML storyboard. This book will refer to both as a storyboard.
