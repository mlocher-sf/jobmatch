# automatically if ANY file in the CLASSPATH changes.  NOTE:  This is a
# debugging option and may slow down the performance of your application.
# The CLASSPATH should NOT contain any directories (or underlying directories)
# that contain constantly changing files, i.e. a log file.  For example, do
# NOT include the application's output directory in the CLASSPATH because it
# contains the application log files in the underlying log directory.
