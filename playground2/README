 To build and run playground:

1) Type "make" in this directory.

2) The application will be compiled, with the resulting class files put in
   the classes directory. Then a jar file will be created in output/lib.
   the application's config file will be placed in the directory
   output. An Enhydra Multiserver config file will also be placed
   in the output directory, along with a start script.
3) Type "cd output".
4) Type "./start".
5) Use your web browser to access playground at:  http://localhost:9000


NOTES:
 localhost can also be your host name or 127.0.0.1 (best for Win95).
