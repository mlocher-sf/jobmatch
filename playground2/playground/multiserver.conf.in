#
# If you want to use the Multiserver's graphical administration program,
# first copy it's config file to the directory Server.confDir is set to:
#
#     cp /home/scg/Software/enhydra/enhydra3.0/apps/multiserverAdmin.conf @OUTPUT@
#
# Then uncomment the following lines, re-run the Multiserver (./start),
# and connect to port 9001. The default username is "admin" and the default
# password is "lutris". This can be changed by editing the local copy of
# multiserverAdmin.conf.
#
# If you are going to be adding other applications, other servlets, or
# other connections, it is highly recommended that you use the graphical
# admin rather than edit this file by hand (remember to save your changes
# by clicking on the "Save State" button!).
