Installation Instructions for ``JOBMATCH''


1 Setting up the environment

1.1 Required Modules

The following modules have to be loaded for proper compilation and
use of Jobmatch:

* java2

* enhydra3.0    www.enhydra.org

* iText         www.lowagie.com

* junit

* jpython

* icontract

* javamail



We suggest that you load these modules in your .login file. The specific
part in a typical .login file may look like this:

module unload java1

module load java2

module load junit jpython icontract javamail enhydra iText

1.2 Unpacking and Compilation

* Unpack the files in a directory.

* After that, run the make-script in this directory.

The application will then be compiled. As a final result, an Enhydra
  Multiserver config file will be created in the output directory,
  along with a start script.

2 Running the Application

2.1 Starting the Application

* Type ``cd output''

* Type ``./start''

2.2 Using the Application

In order to see the application running, start your webbrowser and
access jobmatch at:

http://localhost:9004

3 General Considerations

Watch out when compiling the application: On a SUN ULTRA1, equipped
with 64 MB of ram, this procedure may take over one hour to complete !
